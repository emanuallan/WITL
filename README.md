# PURPLE PUNDIT

Detecting and understanding bias is an important aspect of politics.
Therefore, the Purple Pundit project was created to better simplify and display the political differences
that exist within each of the major media news outlets available. Thanks to the NewsApi.org, Purple Pundit currently features over 50 media sources including
CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, The Washington Times, amongst others. The color that determines the political bias of each of the sources is determined by the
Media Bias Fact Checker.
                 
In an age in which effective political discussion is held to a minimum
and corrupted with identity politics, it is important to understand both sides of the argument. Purple Pundit was created not with
the intent to encourage either political side, rather it was created to promote discussion, comprehension, and the well-informed individual.
